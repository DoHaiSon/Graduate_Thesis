  abstract = {Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical
	practice, long acquisition times limit its practical utility in many
	applications. To increase the data acquisition speed of MRI, parallel
	MRI (pMRI) techniques have recently been proposed. These techniques
	utilize multi-channel receiver arrays and are based on simultaneous
	acquisition of data from multiple receiver coils. Recently, a novel
	framework called Compressed Sensing (CS) was introduced. Since this
	new framework illustrates how signals can be reconstructed from much
	fewer samples than suggested by the Nyquist theory, it has the potential
	to significantly accelerate data acquisition in MRI. This paper illustrates
	that CS and pMRI techniques can be combined and such joint processing
	yields results that are superior to those obtained from independent
	utilization of each technique.},
