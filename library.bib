abstract = {This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition with that suggested by a study group of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,) Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are given next. The first considers distribution network active management and future development trends in technologies and methods, where centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid. Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new and innovative research approaches and results are included. These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI) in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for wind-thermal-pumped storage systems, optimized power system restoration, robust data transmission upon compressive sensing, data fusion for wide-area oscillation monitoring, satellite based GPS synchronized monitoring systems, stability in Smart Grid with emerging renewable energy techno- logies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

(For a more detailed description of the FCS program see CRS Report RL32888, The Army's Future Combat System(FCS): Background and Issues for Congress, by Andrew Feickert.) JTRS, envisioned as a family of software programmable radios, has been described as the "backbone" of the FCS and is intended to link the 18 manned and unmanned systems that would constitute FCS. Two JTRS sub-programs managed by the Army – Cluster One and Cluster Five – have experienced developmental difficulties, delays, and cost overruns which calls into question their viability.

abstract = {Experimental research on wireless communication protocols frequently requires full access to all protocol layers, down to and including the physical layer. Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware platforms, together with real-time signal processing frameworks, offer a basis to implement transceivers that can allow such experimentation and sophisticated measurements. We present a complete Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) receiver implemented in GNU Radio and fitted for operation with an Ettus USRP N210. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prototype of a GNU Radio based OFDM receiver for this technology. Our receiver comprises all layers up to parsing the MAC header and extracting the payload of IEEE 802.11a/g/p networks. It supports both WiFi with a bandwidth of 20MHz and IEEE802.11p DSRC with a bandwidth of 10MHz. We validated and verified our implementation by means of interoperability tests, and present representative performance measurements. By making the code available as Open Source we provide an easy-to-access system that can be readily used for experimenting with novel signal processing algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the real time implementation of CDMA, a multiple access technique, which brings forth the complete bandwidth usage by spreading the data of same transmitted power, over the whole bandwidth thereby ensuring safe communication and preventing the occurrence of jamming. GNU Radio is a software defined radio which puts experiments into practice using software rather than the normal hardware implementation. Blocks for data spreading, code despreading with and without code tracking are created using Zero Correlation Zone code (ZCZ, a combination of ternary codes that is 1, 0 and -1 which is specified in the program). Thus the real time implementation of CDMA checks the feasibility of an asynchronous multiuser communication among users with good results.},

abstract = {The output of an array of sensors is considered to be a homogeneous random field. In this case there is a spectral representation for this field. similar to that for stationary random processes. which consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequencywavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses.a fixed wavenumber window and its resolution is-determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana, In addition. the application of the high-resolution method to other areas. such as radar. sonar. and radio astronomy. is indicated.},

IoT gateways that connects WSN to the Internet are exposed to all conventional IP attacks. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach using support vector machines (SVM) for WSN intrusion detection, and deep learning technique for gateway intrusion detection. We propose a detection protocol that dynamically executes the on-demand SVM classifier in a hierarchical way whenever an intrusion is suspected. We combine machine learning classification with a statistical approach for malicious node localization. This novel approach allows finding a compromise between intrusion detection efficiency and resource overhead for WSN and gateway security.},

abstract = {—An IMSI-catcher, also known as a cell-site-simulator, is a telephone eavesdropping device mainly used by law enforcement. By simulating a cell-site it can force mobile phones to connect with the fake cell-site and force unencrypted (A5/0) communication. IMSI-catchers used to be expensive and only available to law-enforcement. Nowadays an IMSI catcher can be set up cheaply using a software defined radio and open source software such as OpenBTS. Deloitte would like to find out if this technology can be used for gathering OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) for red-teams.To set up the IMSI catcher the Blade-RF x40 was used running YateBTS. Then observations were made on how effective this IMSI catcher actually is in spoofing a modern phone. YateBTS is capable of simulating a 2.5G (GPRS) cell site and it was observed that phones always prefer the faster base station (regardless of signal strength). The general conclusion is that an IMSI catcher isn't as effective nowadays against modern phones, and require specific conditions along with forcing the use of 2G for the IMSI catcher to work. Acknowledgements—I would like to thank the hacking team of Deloitte for enabling me to work and lending the necessary hardware to conduct the experiments. Also, I would like to thank Cedric van Bockhaven for helping with the initial setup of YateBTS, as well as pointing out the current status of A5/1.},

This report is concerned first with the multiple emitter aspect of this problem and second with the generality of solution. A description is given of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of 1) number of incident wavefronts present; 2) directions of arrival (DOA) (or emitter locations); 3) strengths and cross correlations among the incident waveforms; 4) noise/interference strength. Examples and comparisons with methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum entropy (ME), as well as conventional beamforming are included.

Thus, a more efficient use of the radio spectrum is required. Smart antenna systems are capable of efficiently utilizing the radio spectrum and, thus, is a promise for an effective solution to the present wireless systems' problems while achieving reliable and robust high-speed high-data-rate transmission. The purpose of this book is to provide the reader abroad view of the system aspects of smart antennas. In fact, smart antenna systems comprise several critical areas such as individual antenna array design, signal processing algorithms, space-time processing, wireless channel modeling and coding, and network performance. In this book we include an overview of smart antenna concepts, introduce some of the areas that impact smart antennas, and examine the influence of interaction and integration of these areas to Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. In addition, the general principles and major benefits of using space-time processing are introduced, especially employing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques.

abstract = {Emerging conflict scenarios are highlighting US vulnerabilities to terrorist engagements and espionage. Warfighters and intelligence agencies must leverage the electromagnetic spectrum in new ways to "put steel on target" and collect information on adversaries. Emerging software defined radio systems (SDR) can be used well beyond their intended JTRS communications mission to locate threats in a "stand-in" signal collection mode, and coordinate offensive resources and other JTRS systems to neutralize the threat. In this manner, the programmable communication system is transformed into a flexible signal collection resource that locates hostile signals both in spectrum and geography, becoming an intelligence and combat multiplier. Ultimately, this approach will leverage the ubiquitous presence of SDR platforms on the near-future battlespace to significantly enhance warfighter survivability while presenting new opportunities for distributed signal collection and analysis.},

abstract = {We have implemented a TDOA multilateration of transmitters on an unmodified rtl-sdr receiver using transmitters with known location as a timing reference. We present a brief theoretical background and describe the measurement process which includes several approaches that correct the timing and frequency errors between the receivers. Additionally, we have implemented an angle of arrival direction finder using coherent rtl-sdr. },

abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10–100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},
